title: Gaming within an AIgorithm

As I think about how to begin this explanation I keep getting dragged further back into my own memory. It really began (as many things do) with the Halo 2 collector's edition DVD.

This DVD housed groundbreaking knowledge for a young teenage Andrew and opened my mind to the prospect of game development and AI. I suddenly wanted to learn how to code. I wanted to learn how to make games, and how AI worked. I looked up how decision trees work and was ultimately disappointed by how simple the underlying systems were.

Fast forward a few years. I'm studying Computer Science at Monash. The opportunity arises to join a vacation scholarship at CSIRO, with one of the potential research projects being AI-related. I jump on it and spend the summer of 2011/2012 contributing to a research project that was using Genetic Algorithms to make improvements in materials engineering. I implement a particle swarm optimization algorithm to compete with the genetic algorithm and ultimately nothing much comes from it except furthering my interest in AI.

It's now 2015 and AI and genetic algorithms are still bouncing around in my head. I'm in my final year at the Academy of Interactive Entertainment, truly believing game development would be a worthwhile career. We're given our final year project: conceive, pitch, and build a game. My pitch is heavily influenced by my desire to incorporate genetic algorithms in a meaningful way. It's a zombie twin-stick shooter (how original) except the zombie virus will mutate the zombies differently based on the virus "genome" (aka a bunch of random variables). The game will simulate the zombie infection before you play, and as you play. I thought it was interesting, and it barely scraped through the pitch stage. Looking back I kinda wish it hadn't made it through at all. Of course the scope was way out of line and unachievable for a group of novice developers and artists. We shrank the scale to fighting an infection of cells in the bloodstream while attempting to keep core mechanics the same.

It's been a while since then. Deep inside me the desire to make a cool little game that plays with complex mechanics in a novel way is still bouncing around. The other day the thought crossed my mind: "If i wanted to make a game that takes place _inside_ an LLM, how would that work?". This is the sort of question that I love. It sounds stupid or crazy but I know that it's possible.

I guess I'm going to try to spend my next few blog posts answering that question. And better to put it down in blog form so I don't forget what I figure out. I'm tired of thinking of neat ideas only for them to slide out of my brain when I'm not looking.

Alright peace
